- Updated `ai_flow_generation_modal.dart` with diagnostic button

### Step 2: Test the Diagnostic 🧪

1. **Open your app**
2. **Go to Flow Studio** (tap the calendar icon)
3. **Tap the AI generation button** (✨ sparkle icon)

## 🔍 Most Likely Issues

Based on the error "Something went wrong on our end", here are the most probable causes:

| Issue | Probability | Quick Fix |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Edge Function not deployed** | 🔴 70% | `supabase functions deploy ai_generate_flow` |
| **Missing API keys** | 🟡 20% | `supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` |
| **Auth header issue** | 🟢 10% | Use updated service file |

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic** (2 minutes)
2. **Share the screenshot** with me

## 🛠️ Alternative: Check Supabase Dashboard

If you want to check manually while the diagnostic runs:

### A. Verify Edge Function Deployment
1. Go to: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/functions`
2. Check if `ai_generate_flow` is listed
3. Check deployment status (should be green/deployed)

### B. Check Edge Function Logs
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → `ai_generate_flow`
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for recent errors

### C. Verify Secrets Are Set
1. Go to: Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Verify these exist:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Run the diagnostic and share the results - that will tell us exactly what needs to be fixed!** 🎯
