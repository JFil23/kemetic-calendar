# Kemetic Calendar (Flutter)

A lightweight Flutter app that shows today in the **Ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) calendar** and a simple month view. It converts between Gregorian and Kemetic dates, highlights the current day, and lets you add sample events (local, in-memory) for any Kemetic day.

## âœ¨ Features

- Kemetic â†”ï¸Ž Gregorian conversion (with seasons & epagomenal days)
- Clean month grid (30-day months, 7 columns)
- Tap a day to add a **sample local event** (stored in memory)
- State management with **provider**
- Unit tests for the converter
